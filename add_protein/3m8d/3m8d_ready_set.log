    Reading model from 3m8d.pdb
    Reading restraints from cnc.cif
    Writing effective parameters to 3m8d.eff

  Preparation for phenix.refine

    Add hydrogens
      - to protein model using phenix.reduce
      - to ligands using eLBOW, phenix.elbow

  Build ligand and use user provided restraints : MTN

  Build ligand and use user provided restraints : CNC
	Difficulties in the ring structures may lead to problems later

  Build ligand and use monomer library to name atoms : C8E
  Using monomer library entry C8E as template

  User defined restraints for MTN added to output restraints

  User defined restraints for CNC added to output restraints

  Reduce warnings
WARNING: atom CO from CNC will be treated as cobolt
